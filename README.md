# Instagram Clone

This is a step-by-step guide to create an Instagram clone using Ruby on Rails. The tutorial covers various aspects of building a social media application, including adding Bootstrap for styling, implementing a footer and navbar, validating the post model, adding user authentication using Devise, connecting user authentication to the post model, adding a like button to posts, adding followers and following counter to users, and deploying the Ruby on Rails app to Fly.io or another hosting site.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Ruby on Rails framework
- Development environment set up with Ruby and Rails installed
- Familiarity with web development concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Ruby on Rails app using the `rails new` command.
2. Set up the initial project structure and configurations.
3. Add Bootstrap framework to enhance the UI of the Rails app.
4. Implement a footer and navbar for consistent site navigation.
5. Validate the post model to ensure data integrity.
6. Add user authentication using the Devise gem.
7. Connect user authentication to the post model for user-specific posts.
8. Add a like button to allow users to express appreciation for posts.
9. Implement a followers and following counter to track social connections.
10. Deploy the Ruby on Rails app to Fly.io or another hosting site for public access.

## Step 1: Creating a new Ruby on Rails app

In this step, we'll create a new Ruby on Rails app using the `rails new` command. This will set up the initial project structure and necessary configurations.

## Step 2: Adding Bootstrap, Footer, and Navbar

Next, we'll integrate the Bootstrap framework into our Rails app to enhance the UI. We'll also add a footer and navbar to provide consistent site navigation.

## Step 3: Validating our Post Model

In this step, we'll implement validations for the post model to ensure that the data entered by users meets certain criteria. This will help maintain data integrity within the application.

## Step 4: Adding User Authentication using Devise

To add user authentication functionality to our Instagram clone, we'll use the Devise gem. Devise provides a set of pre-built features for user registration, login, and password management.

## Step 5: Connecting User Authentication to Post Model

In this step, we'll connect the user authentication system to the post model. This will allow us to associate each post with the user who created it, enabling user-specific posts and ensuring data privacy.

## Step 6: How to Add a Like Button to Posts

To add the ability for users to like posts, we'll implement a like button. This will allow users to express their appreciation for posts they find interesting or engaging.

## Step 7: Adding a Followers and Following Counter to Users

In this step, we'll implement a followers and following counter for users. This will provide social metrics and enable users to see the number of followers they have and the number of users they are following.

## Step 8: Deploying our Ruby on Rails app to Fly.io or another hosting site

Finally, we'll deploy our Ruby on Rails app to a hosting site such as Fly.io. This will make our Instagram clone accessible to the public and allow users to interact with it.

Each step in the tutorial focuses on a specific feature or functionality. Follow the instructions provided in each step to build your Instagram clone. Enjoy the process and have fun creating your own social media application!
